// A half-life is the amount of time it takes for a substance or entity to fall to half its original value. 
// Caffeine has a half-life of about 6 hours in humans. Given caffeine amount (in mg) as input, output the 
// caffeine level after 6, 12, and 24 hours.

// Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
// cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

// Ex: If the input is:
// 100

// the output is:
// After 6 hours: 50.00 mg
// After 12 hours: 25.00 mg
// After 24 hours: 6.25 mg

// Note: A cup of coffee has about 100 mg. A soda has about 40 mg. An "energy" drink (a misnomer) has 
// between 100 mg and 200 mg.
